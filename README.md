# Crab Age Prediction
Statistical learning group project.

The authors of the project are:
- Chiara Anni (https://github.com/chiaraanni)
- Guglielmo Berzano (me)
- Alessandro Cantoni (https://github.com/AleCantoni117)
- Michela Mazzaglia (https://github.com/michaglia)

- Riccardo Sturla (https://github.com/RiccardoSturla)

We are all students of the Data Science for Economics master's degree at UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano Statale.

The aim of the project is to predict the expected living time of a crab ðŸ¦€ given info about its body.
This will be performed through statistical learning operations, both in the supervised and in the unsupervised framework.

Hope you enjoy!!
